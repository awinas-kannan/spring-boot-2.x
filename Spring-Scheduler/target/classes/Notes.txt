Spring Scheduler: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92-qLIxv0JA
Piece of business job ,that should run on schedulaed basis
Its a part of spring , so no need to add any special dependency
Tells spring container to run partucular method 

@EnableScheduling -> in Any configuration class ( Class should be annotated with @Configuration)
Adding this configutaiotn to Spring boot main class , will be enabled in unit test & integration test ( will cause probled while using syp bean
or Mock bean)
So its better we add it in seperate class.

Scheduler can be enabled based on
@ConditionalOnProperty(name = { "schedular.enabled" }, havingValue = "" )

Add schedular.enabled in env variable
schedular.enabled=true
havingValue = true / "" -> scheduler will run
havingValue = false  / "xx" ->scheduler will not run

@Scheduled(fixedRate = 2000l) -> Runs the program every two seconds
@Scheduled(fixedDelay = 2000l) -> Runs the Program after two seconds of completing the program.
