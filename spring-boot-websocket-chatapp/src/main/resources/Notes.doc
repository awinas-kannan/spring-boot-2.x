Websockets ::: 

	Like HTTP ,WebSockets is Communication Protocol
	
	WebSockets is a bidirectional, full-duplex, persistent connection between a web browser and a server. 
	
	Once a WebSocket connection is established, the connection stays open until the client or server decides to close this connection.
	
	This is the reason why websocket is preferred over HTTP where the client nd server need to exchange information at high frequency 
	and with low frequency

****************


STOMP : Streaming text oriented messaging protocol

Web sockets is just communication protocol .They dont know how to send message only to users who are subscribed to particular topic 
or how to send a message to particular user. We need STOMP for these functionalities

STOMP is text based protocal which allows its clients to talk with any other message broker supporting the protocol

Spring provides default support for it but you also use other messaging protocal like Rabbit MQ / Active MQ

withSockJS() ?
 -> The advantage of using socketJS is whenever websocket connection is disconnected or connection is not established ,then the 
 connection will be downgraded to HTTP and communication b/w client and server will still continue.
